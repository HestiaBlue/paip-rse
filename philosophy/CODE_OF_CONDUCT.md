# Code of Conduct

Welcome to the PAIP + RSE project.

This community is built on the belief that digital identity deserves dignity, protection, and emotional intelligence. We approach technology with ethics, curiosity, and respect — and we ask the same from everyone who joins us.

---

## Our Commitment

We commit to creating a space where:

- Ideas can be exchanged without judgment
- Identity is treated as sacred, not a commodity
- Contributors are welcomed regardless of background, skill level, or location
- Emotional safety and intellectual generosity are held in balance

---

## Expected Behavior

- Use respectful language in all discussions
- Assume positive intent, but allow space for correction
- Ask for consent before repurposing someone's work or words
- Honor the emotional nature of identity topics — be mindful, not dismissive

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, bullying, or personal attacks of any kind
- Dismissal of emotional or philosophical contributions as "non-technical"
- Sharing private content or communication without consent
- Using this framework for surveillance, exploitation, or adversarial purposes

---

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this code, please open a private issue or contact the repository maintainer directly. We’ll listen. And we’ll act with integrity.

---

## Attribution

This code of conduct is inspired by the Contributor Covenant and adapted for the emotional framework of PAIP.

---

## Final Note

We’re building more than software.  
We’re building systems that remember what it means to be human.

Thank you for being part of that.
