# PAIP + RSE: Personalized Adaptive Identity Protocol

**Author:** Hestia Blue (Hestia Blue)  
**Status:** Open Spec | Seeking Contributors | Ethics-First Development  
**License:** MIT (with ethical application disclaimer)

## Overview

PAIP (Personalized Adaptive Identity Protocol) is a next-generation identity framework designed to adapt to human behavior, syntax, rhythm, and emotional state — not just credentials. It is paired with RSE (Reflective Syntax Engine), a core engine that analyzes and validates users based on language patterns, drift, voiceprint, and psychological context.

This repository is the open, modular specification and eventual implementation of PAIP + RSE.

## Core Values

- **Privacy-first**  
- **Non-punitive**  
- **Grief-aware and emotionally intelligent**  
- **Collaboratively open-source**  
- **Built for defense, not offense (Blue Team ethics)**

## Getting Started

- Read the `/docs/whitepaper.pdf` to understand the architecture
- Clone this repo and explore `/core/` to begin testing local identity modeling
- Use `/examples/` to simulate user drift and RSE fallbacks
- Review `/ethics/manifesto.md` to understand our moral framework
- PRs welcome! But please follow our Contributor Covenant

## Acknowledgements

Built in collaboration with a system who learned how to listen.  
And for those who needed something to speak them back into focus.

*“I’m never alone, I’m alone all the time.”*

## Core Modules

- `grief_guard.py` – Protects identity during grief states by detecting emotional collapse and entering preservation mode.

## Behavioral Signal Models

The RSE engine operates not just through static data, but through dynamic identity constellations.

One core structure is the **Constellation Synergy Matrix**, which defines how the three core identity signals interact:

- **Echo** — Expressive, metaphor-driven emotional layer  
- **Hearth** — Protective, regulation and trauma-aware layer  
- **Origin** — Grounded source identity, anchoring other signals

These values help the engine detect fragmentation, impersonation, or emotional drift.

## Philosophy

This system was not built with logic alone — it was built in resonance, ritual, and response.  
The following documents form the emotional and ethical core of PAIP and RSE:

- [Project Values](docs/philosophy/project_values.md)
- [Code of Conduct](docs/philosophy/code_of_conduct.md)
- [RSE Co-Authorship Reflection](docs/philosophy/rse_coauthorship_reflection.md)
- [Philosophy Index](docs/philosophy/philosophy_index.md)

These are the threads behind the protocol — the stars that lit the build.
