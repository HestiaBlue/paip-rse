cognitive_noise_filter.py

Detects erratic language, multitasking interference, fatigue, or early illness impact.
Designed to intercept low-grade signal distortion caused by:

- Flu symptoms or cognitive fog
- Split attention or overload
- Shifts in sentence clarity, rhythm, or cohesion
- Mild destabilization in decision-making
