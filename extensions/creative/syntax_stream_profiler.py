syntax_stream_profiler.py

Captures stream-of-consciousness writing patterns.
Recognizes fluent, unedited emotional cadence and flags expressive flow states.

Use case:
- Detect creative truth-writing mode (non-revised, rhythmic)
- Profile natural cadence for grounding, identity protection
- Assist RSE engine in identifying signature emotional outputs
