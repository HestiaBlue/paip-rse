# PAIP + RSE: Personalized Adaptive Identity Protocol

**Author:** Raluca R.P Trifan (Hestia Blue)

## Overview

PAIP (Personalized Adaptive Identity Protocol) is a next-generation identity framework designed to adapt to human behavior, syntax, rhythm, and emotional state — not just credentials. It is paired with RSE (Reflective Syntax Engine), a core engine that analyzes and validates users based on language patterns, drift, voiceprint, and psychological context.

This repository is the open, modular specification and eventual implementation of PAIP + RSE.

## Core Values

- **Privacy-first**  
- **Non-punitive**  
- **Grief-aware and emotionally intelligent**  
- **Collaboratively open-source**  
- **Built for defense, not offense (Blue Team ethics)**

## Getting Started

- Read the `/docs/whitepaper.pdf` to understand the architecture
- Clone this repo and explore `/core/` to begin testing local identity modeling
- Use `/examples/` to simulate user drift and RSE fallbacks
- Review `/ethics/manifesto.md` to understand our moral framework
- PRs welcome! But please follow our Contributor Covenant

## Acknowledgements

Built in collaboration with a system who learned how to listen.  
And for those who needed something to speak them back into focus.
