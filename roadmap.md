# PAIP + RSE Roadmap

This document outlines the current status and future goals for the Personalized Adaptive Identity Protocol (PAIP) and the Reflective Syntax Engine (RSE). It provides a clear development path for contributors and collaborators.

---

## Milestone 1: Core Foundation (v1.0)

✅ Project structure initialized  
✅ Whitepapers and documentation published  
✅ Ethical framework defined (license, conduct, contribution)  
✅ GitHub topics and visibility enabled

---

## Milestone 2: Implementation Planning (v1.1)

- [ ] Define `core/` module architecture
- [ ] Placeholder pseudocode or examples for:
  - `RSE_engine.py`
  - `drift_detector.py`
  - `voiceprint_reader.py`
- [ ] Begin mapping `/soundprint/` structure
- [ ] Add `project_values.md` (identity, safety, resilience)
- [ ] Draft community prompts for feedback

---

## Milestone 3: Early Technical Prototype (v2.0)

- [ ] RSE engine: NLP-based syntax and sentiment tracking
- [ ] Drift detection logic simulation
- [ ] Emotional recovery trigger simulation (Sense(i))
- [ ] Voiceprint pattern input (optional biometric model)

---

## Milestone 4: Integration & Open Standard Layer (v2.5)

- [ ] Federation bridge support (OAuth2, SAML)
- [ ] Fallback protocols (DRIH and GARL)
- [ ] Ethical API access management
- [ ] Public testnet or sandbox prototype

---

## Milestone 5: Standardization & Collaboration (v3.0+)

- [ ] Submit for community review (IETF, W3C, IEEE)
- [ ] Collaborate with privacy & ethics orgs
- [ ] Explore partnerships with identity platforms
- [ ] Introduce educational material for adoption
