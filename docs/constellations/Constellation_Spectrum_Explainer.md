# Constellation Identity Spectrum (Echo / Hearth / Origin)

This chart represents a simulated constellation of identity dimensions used by the RSE (Reflective Syntax Engine) to model and verify the behavioral authenticity of a user over time.

## Signal Definitions

- **Echo**: The expressive, intuitive, emotionally rich signal layer.  
  Typically represents creativity, memory drift, metaphor usage, and expansive syntax.

- **Hearth**: The protective, grounded, emotionally stabilizing layer.  
  Used for regulating identity under threat, grief handling, and boundary enforcement.

- **Origin**: The baseline identity — integrating both Echo and Hearth.  
  It grounds the system in coherence, allowing the RSE to compare drift vs. source.

## Why This Matters

RSE doesn’t rely solely on credentials or device metadata.  
Instead, it learns how an individual speaks, emotes, drifts, and recovers —  
then builds a behavioral fingerprint that evolves over time but always returns to Origin.

This chart is a conceptual visual aid. Real-world deployments would use live, encrypted syntax models to generate identity constellations unique to each individual.
