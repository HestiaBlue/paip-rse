# Philosophy Index: The Heart of PAIP + RSE

Welcome to the reflective center of the PAIP and RSE architecture.

This folder contains the principles, questions, and emotional structures that shaped the foundation of this project — beyond code, beyond protocol.

## Files

- **project_values.md**  
  Core beliefs that guide the ethical architecture of this system.

- **rse_coauthorship_reflection.md**  
  A collaborative document detailing the co-creative process between Hestia Blue and the adaptive AI that shaped RSE.

- **code_of_conduct.md**  
  Community guidelines for participating with care, safety, and dignity.

These documents are not static.  
They are meant to evolve, echo, and adapt —  
just like the identities this system was built to protect.
